Job-contracts are a specification of a generic interface that a job-template can fulfill. This allows the server to group/search job-templates that perform similar functions. A contract can be parametrised by a set of types, and specifies which inputs a job-template must take (including their types), and which outputs it must produce (again, including type), to meet the contract. The types of the inputs/outputs can be specified generically, so a job-template can say that it fulfills a contract in relation to the type-parametrisation of the contract. E.g. A training contract which trains a model on a dataset: contract Train<Domain, Framework> { execute(dataset: PK<Dataset<Domain>>) -> Model<Domain, Framework>; } This contract specifies how job-templates that are designed to train models should appear. A job-template can train a model in a particular domain , using a particular framework , and in order to do so, must be passed the primary-key of a dataset in the given domain , and must produce a model for the given domain/framework . Job-templates which meet this contract can also take in additional parameters, and produce additional outputs, but this contract specifies the minimum requirements necessary to qualify the job-template as training a model . Similar to job-types , job-contracts are specified as Python classes. The information kept by the server is meta-data about where to find the Python class that defines the contract.

Workable templates specify an executor , which is a Python class which implements the functionality that jobs created from a template will perform. Meta-templates specify a graph of other templates to enact, and how to connect the outputs from prior jobs to subsequent jobs. This allows for re-using templates to create higher-order jobs.
