# Licenses

This directory contains licenses and their associated
permissions, limitations and conditions.

Each file has the following format:

* `p:` - prefix for permission
* `l:` - prefix for limitation
* `c:` - prefix for condition
* `u:` - prefix for URL for an example displaying permissions/limitations/conditions

The `combine.sh` script combines all the license files 
and then extracts:

* `_permissions.txt` - list of all available permissions
* `_limitations.txt` - list of all available limitations
* `_conditions.txt` - list of all available conditions
