Instead of storing data items (images, audio or video files) in a database,
they simply get stored on disk. In order to avoid a skewed distribution
files, a hash-based approach to creating a directory structure is used:

* compute hash for data item (using content, not name, to allow for deduplication)
* create directory structure (eg from AABBCCDD.jpg generate /AA/BB)
* place file in that directory, using the hash as name (eg /AA/BB/AABBCCDD.jpg)
